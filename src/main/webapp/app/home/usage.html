                        Search the issues you would like to add to the report. Go to Jira -> "Search for issues" and
                        filter the issues you are interested in reporting.

                                <li> Then add your search terms. I will strongly recommend to add the epics
                                    to
                                    your search, this way you could summarize your report by epics.
                                    <p>In the example below, we use the query <i>"type=Epic or (sprint=7 and status=Done)"</i> to
                                    search for all issues which are epics or all issues included in the sprint 7 and are done.</p>
